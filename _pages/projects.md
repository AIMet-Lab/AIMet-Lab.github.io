### SECURED - Scaling Up secure Processing, Anonymization and generation of Health Data for EU cross border collaborative research and Innovation

<p style='line-height:1;font-style:italic'><small>HORIZON-HLTH-2022-IND-13 - Duration: 2023-2025 - Role: Partner - Project Value: 6.999.723,75 € </small></p>

The overall goal of the SECURED project is to scale up multiparty computation, data anonymization and synthetic data generation, by increasing efficiency and improving security, with a focus on private and unbiased artificial intelligence and data analytics, health-related data and data hubs, and cross-border cooperation. The project will address the limitations that are currently preventing the widespread use of secure multiparty computation and effective anonymization, namely: the limited practical capabilities of current cryptographic schemes for secure multi-party computation protocols, and their performance; the lack of well understood and standardized data anonymization methods for health data; the absence of dynamic and on demand services for generating synthetic data; the complex and ad-hoc nature of current federation protocols for machine learning and AI-based data analytics; the lack of support for health technology providers to implement privacy enhancing technologies, in particular SMEs.

SECURED will tackle these challenges by focusing on scaling up privacy technologies via algorithmic improvements and implementation efficiency (HW and SW), as well as the generalization of primitives and definitions, with the aim of speeding up and facilitating privacy preserving data-driven tools and services for wellbeing, prevention, diagnosis, treatment and follow-up care. SECURED will also analyse the current ethical and legal challenges to data sharing, and is targeted at overcoming current limited adoption of advanced multi-party computation and data anonymization technologies by providing direct support to health technology SMEs through a funding call. To ensure relevance to real-world settings, SECURED will showcase the technologies developed in four health-related use cases provided by partner hospitals and health stakeholders, namely: real-time tumor classification; telemonitoring for children; synthetic data generation for education; access to genomic data.

The use of drones today is expanding as it reduces costs and offers environmental benefits. However, existing technologies could make drones’ usage harmful for humans, vehicles and properties. SESAR JU, in charge of EU research in air traffic management, suggested that further investments and motivations are needed for the safe use of drones. The ECSEL JU-funded project COMP4DRONES will work on safe software and hardware drone solutions aligned with SESAR objectives. Coordinated by Indra, COMP4DRONES brings together 49 partners from 8 countries aiming to build an ecosystem that will support the systemization and safety of drone platforms, reliable communications, cost-efficient and safe design of drones. COMP4DRONES will deploy applications in five domains: transport, construction, surveillance and inspection, logistics and agriculture.
